Tidy Data
The tidy_data.txt data file is a data set that has been merged, cleaned and filtered from a bigger and untidy data set which comprises of 3 sets and 8 files
3 sets of the data
The values of 'Activity' consist of data from 'y_train.txt' and 'y_test.txt'
The values of 'Subject' consist of data from 'subject_train.txt' and 'subject_test.txt'
The values of 'Features' consist of data from 'X_train.txt' and 'X_test.txt'
8 Files used for the data cleaning
X_train.txt
X_test.txt
y_train.txt
y_test.txt
subject_train.txt
subject_test.txt
activity_labels.txt
features.txt
The first row contains the Variable names, described in details under Variables section, and following rows are the values of these variables
Variables
ActivityId
6 Activity identifier are there based on which the features of the 30 subjects were recorded:

SubjectId
Subject Identifiers are the subject who performed the activities for each window sample. It ranges from 1 to 30.

Data cleaning steps
The source data zip file is located at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
The following work that was performed to clean up the Source data:
1. The source data is downloaded and extracted from the zip file
2. The training and test sets were merged to create one data set.
3. The measurements on the mean and standard deviation (i.e. signals containing the strings mean and std) were extracted for each measurement, and the others were discarded.
4. The activity identifiers (originally coded as integers between 1 and 6) were replaced with descriptive activity names.
5. The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names (e.g. tBodyAcc-mean()-X was expanded to timeBodyAccelerometer-Mean-X), using the following set of rules:
      - Special characters (i.e. (, ),) were removed
      - The initial f and t were expanded to frequency and time respectively.
      - Acc, Gyro, mag, mean, and std were replaced with Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnitude, Mean, and StandardDeviation respectively.
      - Replaced BodyBody with Body.
6. From the data set in step 5, the final data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
